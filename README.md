# ⚡ Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing **Electric Vehicle (EV)** data to explore key factors such as **charging cost**, **resale value**, and **vehicle performance metrics**. The project combines **Python (EDA)** and a **Power BI dashboard** to provide both analytical insights and visual storytelling.

---

## 📘 Overview

With the increasing adoption of electric vehicles, understanding the economics and performance behind EV ownership is essential.
This project aims to:

* Analyze **charging cost patterns**
* Compare **resale values** across models
* Visualize **vehicle range and type distribution**
* Create a **Power BI dashboard** for interactive data exploration

---

## 🧠 Key Insights from Python Analysis

* Minimum Monthly Charging Cost: **$7.99**
* Maximum Monthly Charging Cost: **$1,643**
* Minimum Resale Value: **$8,506**
* Maximum Resale Value: **$35,521**

Resale values were categorized into:

* **LOW** (below $15,000)
* **MEDIUM** ($15,000–$30,000)
* **HIGH** (above $30,000)

Visualizations include:

* Distribution of EV types, regions, and manufacturers
* Bar charts of **Range (km)** by **Vehicle Type**
* Comparison of **Make vs. Resale Value**

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was designed in **Power BI**, showing:

* 📈 **Average Charging Cost by Vehicle Type**
* 💰 **Resale Value Distribution**
* 🌍 **Regional Analysis of EV Adoption**
* 🚗 **Make vs Range Comparison**
* 📉 **Correlation between Charging Cost and Range**

The Power BI dashboard enhances data storytelling by allowing drill-down and filtering across EV attributes.
